**WARNING:** installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged

any jailbreak app can grant itself keychain entitlements to your wallet seed and
rob you by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8) and
including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>cc.zinc.*</string>` in its
.entitlements file
